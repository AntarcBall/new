In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
<p>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
<br>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.<br>
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
<br><br>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br><br>
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
<div>And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</div>
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
